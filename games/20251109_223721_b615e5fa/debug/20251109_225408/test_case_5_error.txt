Game completed successfully - distance meter shows 100% (800/800), end card overlay displayed with 'RACING CHAMPION' logo, bullet points ('Epic Racing Action!', 'Challenge Friends!', 'Download Now!'), 4.5-star rating, and 'PLAY NOW' CTA button, audio muted, game paused

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the game in progress, not completed. The distance meter is not at 100%, the end card overlay is not displayed, and the game is not paused. Therefore, it does not match the expected completed game state.
