Test Case: test_case_1
Timestamp: 2025-11-09 22:53:14

Expected Output:
Blue car centered on curved track with white lane markings, 'Drag to steer! Avoid oil spills!' text visible, SPEED meter (top-left) showing 40/60, DISTANCE meter (top-right) showing 0/800, two oil spills on different lanes, static paused state

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the blue car centered on a curved track with white lane markings. The speed meter in the top-left shows 40/60. There are two oil spills visible on different lanes. The game is in a static paused state, as indicated by the lack of movement and the displayed speed. The text 'Drag to steer! Avoid oil spills!' is not visible in the screenshot, which is a discrepancy from the expected output.
