Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_1
Timestamp: 2025-10-27 07:50:59

Expected Output:
Game start screen showing black car centered on asphalt road at bottom, score displays 0, no obstacles visible, grass on both sides of the road

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the game start screen with a black car centered at the bottom, the score displaying 0, and grass on both sides. There are no obstacles visible, and the background appears to be a tiled road pattern rather than a solid asphalt road as described. Specifically, the road is composed of many individual track segments, not a continuous asphalt road.
