Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_2
Timestamp: 2025-11-07 22:29:46

Expected Output:
Player at position (250, 430) on first brown platform, score showing 10, first golden star collected (invisible), remaining 3 stars still visible rotating on other platforms, 'TEST CASE LOADED - TAP TO START!' message visible

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The player character appears to be on the lowest brown platform, not the first brown platform as described. The coordinates are not precise enough to confirm the exact platform, but visually it is not the first one. Additionally, there are 4 yellow stars visible, not 3 remaining stars and 1 collected, invisible star. The text message "TEST CASE LOADED - TAP TO START!" is visible as expected, and the score is 10, also as expected.
