Expected Output:
Game start state with blue player character at position (100, 480) on the green ground, score showing 0, all 4 golden stars visible on brown platforms, 'TEST CASE LOADED - TAP TO START!' message visible, green ground and brown platforms visible

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the blue player character on the left side of the screen, clearly not at the expected position of (100, 480). The score is visible as 0, the stars and platforms are present, and the message "TEST CASE LOADED - TAP TO START!" is visible. However, the player's incorrect positioning is a significant deviation from the expected state.
