Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_3
Timestamp: 2025-11-07 22:32:45

Expected Output:
Player at position (460, 330) on second brown platform (at x=400, y=350), score showing 20, first 2 golden stars collected (invisible), last 2 stars still visible and rotating, 'TEST CASE LOADED - TAP TO START!' message visible

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the player at position (460, 330) on the second brown platform (at x=400, y=350). The score displays "20". Two golden stars are visible and rotating, and the text "TEST CASE LOADED - TAP TO START!" is displayed. The position of the player is not precisely as described (it is on a platform below the one indicated in the description), and the first two golden stars are not "invisible" but rather not present in the screenshot. The description also states "last 2 stars still visible and rotating" which is not reflected in the screenshot either, as there are only two stars visible, and they are not rotating.
