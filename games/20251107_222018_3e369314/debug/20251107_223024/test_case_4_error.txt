========================

Test Case: test_case_4
Timestamp: 2025-11-07 22:30:57

Expected Output:
Player at position (340, 180) on highest brown platform (at x=300, y=200), score showing 40 (maximum), all 4 golden stars collected and invisible, game completion state with all collectibles gathered

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows a player character on a platform, but its position is not (340, 180). The player appears to be on the highest platform, which is located around x=340 and y=180 relative to the screenshot's top-left corner, but the description is precise about the coordinates and the player's current position. Furthermore, there are no visible golden stars, and the game completion state is not indicated. The score is shown as 40, which matches, but the other conditions are not met.
