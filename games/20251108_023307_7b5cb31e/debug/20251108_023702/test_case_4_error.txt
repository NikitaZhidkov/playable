Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_4
Timestamp: 2025-11-08 02:37:32

Expected Output:
Car in center lane with reduced speed (72 = 120 * 0.6), speed text shows red color indicating oil hit slowdown, distance shows 56% (450/800), car should have red tint effect from recent oil collision

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the speed text is red and displays "Speed: 72", which matches the expected reduced speed. The distance displayed is "56%", which is also consistent with the expected 450/800. The car is in the center lane. However, there is no visible red tint effect on the car to indicate a recent oil collision, and the oil blobs on the screen are not the correct shape or color to represent the expected oil hit slowdown effect. Therefore, the visual state does not fully match the description.
