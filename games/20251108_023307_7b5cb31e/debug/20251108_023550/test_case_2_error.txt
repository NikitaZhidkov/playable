Expected Output:
Tutorial step 2 with 'Avoid the oil!' text, red car moved to left lane, yellow hint arrow pointing to oil spill, speed shows 120, distance shows 3%, track has moved slightly indicating some progress

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot displays "Avoid the oil!" text, speed as 120, and distance as 3%. The red car is positioned in the bottom left, which can be considered the left lane. There are multiple oil spills present. However, there is no visible yellow hint arrow pointing to an oil spill, and the track movement is not discernible from a single static screenshot.
