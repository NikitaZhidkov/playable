Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_2
Timestamp: 2025-10-26 23:21:58

Expected Output:
Car moved slightly left from center (350, 500), score displays 25, distance shows 25m, one stone obstacle visible at position (450, 200) on the road

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the score as 25 and the distance as 25m, matching the expected output. The car (represented by the black rectangle at the bottom) appears to be slightly left of center. The orange circle is not a stone obstacle. There is no visible stone obstacle at (450, 200). Therefore, the screenshot does not fully match the expected output.
