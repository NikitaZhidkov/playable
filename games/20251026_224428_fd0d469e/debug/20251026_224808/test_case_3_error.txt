Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_3
Timestamp: 2025-10-26 22:49:29

Expected Output:
Mid-game state with black car positioned right of center, score showing 150, distance 150m, three stones visible at different positions on road creating obstacle course, game paused

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows a "Click anywhere to start!" message, indicating the game is not in a mid-game state and is not paused. The black car is also not visible, but rather a black rectangle which could be interpreted as the car. However, the primary mismatch is the game state being paused.
