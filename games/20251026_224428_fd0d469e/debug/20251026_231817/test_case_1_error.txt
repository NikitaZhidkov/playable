Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_1
Timestamp: 2025-10-26 23:19:55

Expected Output:
Game start state with black car at center-bottom of road (400, 500), score showing 0, distance showing 0m, no stone obstacles visible on the road

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows a green screen with the text "Score: 0" and "Distance: 0m" displayed in the top left corner. There is no black car visible, nor are there any stone obstacles. The description explicitly states that a black car should be visible at a specific position and that no stone obstacles should be visible. Since the car is missing, the screenshot does not match the expected output.
