Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_5
Timestamp: 2025-10-27 08:49:15

Expected Output:
Final lap intense race scenario with bright blue player car in third lap (lap counter shows 3/3), player ahead of bright red AI car, both cars at high speeds racing toward finish line, player car near completion of track, AI car trailing behind, obstacles safely positioned away from spawn areas, this represents a close finish situation where player is about to win

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the player car in red and the AI car in blue, which is the opposite of the expected output. The lap counter also shows 3/3, which is correct, but the positions of the cars and their colors do not match the description.
