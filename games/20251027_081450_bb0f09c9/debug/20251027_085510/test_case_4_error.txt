Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_4
Timestamp: 2025-10-27 08:56:49

Expected Output:
Oil collision aftermath: player car appears stunned (very faded/semi-transparent with alpha around 0.4 and gray tint) positioned at 4:30 o'clock on track, speed shows 10, AI opponent car positioned at 1:30 o'clock continuing race normally, lap counter displays 1/3, circular track with rocks and oil spills visible but positioned away from car spawn points

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the player car at the top of the track, not at 4:30 o'clock. The AI car is also not visible. The lap counter and speed are correct, and there are rocks and oil spills on the track. However, the primary positional requirement for the player car is not met.
