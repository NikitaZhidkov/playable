Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_4
Timestamp: 2025-10-27 08:33:02

Expected Output:
Player car stunned after hitting oil spill, blue car positioned at top-right of circular track (60 degrees), moving slowly (speed shows 10), red AI car continuing normally ahead at right side of track, lap counter shows 1/3, rocks and oil spills visible around the track

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the red car is not in a stunned state (no smoke effect), and the blue car is not at the 60-degree position. The speed indicator shows 10, which is consistent, and the lap counter shows 1/3, also consistent. However, the core conditions about the player car's state and the blue car's position are not met.
