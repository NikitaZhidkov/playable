Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_1
Timestamp: 2025-10-27 08:58:24

Expected Output:
Game start screen with player car positioned at top of circular track (12 o'clock position), AI opponent car positioned at bottom of track (6 o'clock position), both cars stationary, lap counter showing 1/3, speed showing 0, rocks and oil spills scattered around track but safely positioned away from car spawn points, white finish line visible at top of track

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the player car (red) at the bottom of the circular track (6 o'clock position), and the AI opponent car (blue) at the top of the track (12 o'clock position). The expected output stated the opposite. The lap counter and speed are correct, and the obstacles appear to be present and not in spawn locations. However, the car positions are reversed.
