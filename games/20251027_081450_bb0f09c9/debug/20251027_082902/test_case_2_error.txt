Test Case Failure Report
========================

Test Case: test_case_2
Timestamp: 2025-10-27 08:30:16

Expected Output:
Mid-race state with blue player car at right side of track (90 degrees), moving at medium speed (speed display shows 30), red AI car at left side of track, both cars in first lap, lap counter showing 1/3, cars positioned correctly around circular track with rocks and oil obstacles visible

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the blue player car on the left side of the track, not the right side as expected. The red AI car is not clearly visible, and its position is uncertain. The lap counter is correct, and the speed display seems plausible, but the car positioning is incorrect.
