========================

Test Case: test_case_2
Timestamp: 2025-10-27 08:51:52

Expected Output:
Mid-race state with player car positioned at right side of circular track (3 o'clock position), moving at medium speed (speed display shows 30), AI opponent car at left side of track (9 o'clock position), both cars in first lap, lap counter showing 1/3, circular track visible with rocks and oil obstacles scattered around but safely positioned away from racing line

Actual Output (VLM Observation):
The screenshot shows the lap counter as "Lap: 1/3" and the speed as "Speed: 30", matching the expected output. The player car (red) is at the 9 o'clock position, not the 3 o'clock position as expected. The AI opponent car (blue) is at the 3 o'clock position, also not as expected. Obstacles (rocks and oil) are visible on the track and appear to be off the racing line.
